Contacts
An extension for the PreSonus Studio One audio workstation for managing all of your musical contacts.

Entering Data
•	Enter a name into the Name field and hit Add Contact to add it.   You can start that way and add the details later or add the name and details all at once before adding it.

•	There are no separate First Name and Last Name fields, so the preferred method for the Name field is last name, comma, first name, as in Smith, John.  Doing it that way keeps everything sorted alphabetically by last name.

•	You can edit any part of any or all of the details later, including the name.
